When you have 1 minute left of the initial 5-minute period, you will then be given an option to add 2 minutes, which will give you a total of 7 minutes. If you do not take any action (by extending the time or submitting your deal) before the 5-minute period has expired, the vehicle you selected will no longer be reserved.<br><b>2. Search Radius Distance</b> – Your matched vehicle will be within a 100-mile search radius distance of the zip code that you input. The 100-mile search radius distance will be measured by the radius distance from the geographic centroid (sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau) of the zip code that you input or by MAPQUEST Geocoding API coordinates of the zip code that you input.<br><b>3. Time Limit</b> – You must complete your vehicle transaction at the matched dealership within 10 calendar days of your transaction with LetYouKnow (excluding cases where the 10th day falls on the day the dealership is closed, which will then result in a shorter than 10-day period.

Failing to complete your vehicle transaction during the allocated 10 calendar day period, will result in losing your matched vehicle reservation and you will not be refunded the $799.00 nonrefundable Service and Reservation Fee.<br><b>4.

Finance and Payment Responsibility</b> – You are responsible for paying the remaining balance of your matched vehicle (your price plus taxes, titling fees, registration fees and license plate fees, minus your prepayment of the $799.00 nonrefundable Service and Reservation Fee). If you are financing your matched vehicle, it is your responsibility to secure financing for your matched vehicle. If you cannot secure financing, we will not refund the $799.00 nonrefundable Service and Reservation Fee.<br><b>7.
